      <h1>The Life of Samuel Johnson</h1>
      <p>
        Talking of a very respectable authour, he told us a curious circumstance
        in his life, which was, that he had married a printer's devil. REYNOLDS.
        'A printer's devil, Sir! Why, I thought a printer's devil was a creature
        with a black face and in rags.' JOHNSON. 'Yes, Sir. But I suppose, he
        had her face washed, and put clean clothes on her. (Then looking very
        serious, and very earnest.) And she did not disgrace him; the woman had
        a bottom of good sense.' The word bottom thus introduced, was so
        ludicrous when contrasted with his gravity, that most of us could not
        forbear tittering and laughing; though I recollect that the Bishop of
        Killaloe kept his countenance with perfect steadiness, while Miss Hannah
        More slyly hid her face behind a lady's back who sat on the same settee
        with her. His pride could not bear that any expression of his should
        excite ridicule, when he did not intend it; he therefore resolved to
        assume and exercise despotick power, glanced sternly around, and called
        out in a strong tone, 'Where's the merriment?' Then collecting himself,
        and looking aweful, to make us feel how he could impose restraint, and
        as it were searching his mind for a still more ludicrous word, he slowly
        pronounced, 'I say the WOMAN was FUNDAMENTALLY sensible;' as if he had
        said, hear this now, and laugh if you dare. We all sat composed as at a
        funeral.

        He and I walked away together; we stopped a little while by the rails of
        the Adelphi, looking on the Thames, and I said to him with some emotion
        that I was now thinking of two friends we had lost, who once lived in
        the buildings behind us, Beauclerk and Garrick. 'Ay, Sir, (said he,
        tenderly,) and two such friends as cannot be supplied.'
      </p>
      <p>
        For some time after this day I did not see him very often, and of the
        conversation which I did enjoy, I am sorry to find I have preserved but
        little. I was at this time engaged in a variety of other matters, which
        required exertion and assiduity, and necessarily occupied almost all my
        time.
